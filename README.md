# Russian Presidential elections - A Data Visualization Project in Tableau
*created during the Data Analytics Full Time bootcamp at Ironhack Berlin, June 2020*

A rough data analysis of the Russian presidential election results (with an emphasis on statistical anomalies) with Tableau.

## Datasource

This analysis uses a [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/valenzione/russian-presidental-elections-2018-voting-data). The data were originally scraped by that user from official regional election commitees websites and contain voting results for ca 94,500 voting sites from all over the Russian Federation. Although the results calculated from these raw data are pretty close to the offical result, the raw data are "preliminary", "not final" data.
